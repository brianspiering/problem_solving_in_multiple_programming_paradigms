More than one obvious way to do it: Solving the same problem in multiple programming paradigms.

Abstract
-----

Flexibility is one of Python's many advantages. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. In this hands-on tutorial, we are going to explore how to solve the same problem in different programming paradigms. We'll work through a series of coding challenges designed to teach the pros and cons of each of these programming paradigms.

Intended Audience
-------

Intermediate Pythonista - someone who is familiar with defining variables and functions.

Prerequisites
